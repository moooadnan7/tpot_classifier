# tpot_classifier
This project demonstrates the use of TPOT (Tree-based Pipeline Optimization Tool), an automated machine learning library, to classify fetal health conditions. By automating the pipeline selection and hyperparameter tuning process, TPOT identifies the best-performing machine learning model for a given dataset.
